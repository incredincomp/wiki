# General Info and Links

## What are bug bounties?

COMPANIES PAY YOU TO BREAK THEIR PRIZED POSSESSIONS. Then you have to write an epic write up about it and provide a POC \(Proof of Concept,\) and if you'd be so kind as to provide some advice on how to mediate the risk you exploited, companies are much more likely to give you an extra pat on the back.
