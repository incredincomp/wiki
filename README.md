### I hope you don't hurt yourself while you're here, and also that you enjoy your time.
If you're running my code somewhere on something for some reason, be warned.
No specific reason, I am just generally speaking.

### We will mostly be breaking things that work well as they start.
Honestly a lot of it works like crap to start with though so I imagine it as fixing.
