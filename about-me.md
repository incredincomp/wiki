## Young n' Dumb

I'm just a wannabe RedTeamer and bounty hunter with a love for data and computer security.  I find that I enjoy web development, scripting, digital forensics, and everything OPSEC and OSINT.

 I'm awful at everything listed previously, so beware if using any of my configs, programs, scripts, thoughts, words, ideas, or anything else attributed to me as I am and everything I touch is prone to failure at some point.
{% endhint %}

I just have fun doing the stuff I do.  I just want to help people, explore stuff, learn things, and enjoy life.

```bash
apt install carefree-life
